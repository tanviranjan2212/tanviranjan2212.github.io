I am a Research Scientist at [Meta Reality Labs](https://about.meta.com/realitylabs/) working on designing the next generation of brain-computer interfaces.

I finished my PhD in the Applied Math program at [Harvard School of Engineering](https://www.seas.harvard.edu/), working in the [Neuromotor Control lab](https://groups.seas.harvard.edu/motorlab/) with Maurice Smith. There, I did research to study how the human brain controls movements.

In the past, I have collaborated with the [Digital Psychiatry Division](https://www.digitalpsych.org/people.html) at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center on projects around digital phenotyping using mental health apps
