I am a PhD student in the Applied Math program at [Harvard School of Engineering](https://www.seas.harvard.edu/), working in the [Neuromotor Control lab](https://groups.seas.harvard.edu/motorlab/) with Maurice Smith. 

In my research, I use psychophysical experiments to study how the human brain controls movements.

I collaborate with the [Digital Psychiatry Division](https://www.digitalpsych.org/people.html) at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center on projects around digital phenotyping using mental health apps
