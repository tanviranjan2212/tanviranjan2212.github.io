I am a PhD student in the Applied Math program at [Harvard School of Engineering](https://www.seas.harvard.edu/). I work in the [Neuromotor Control lab](https://groups.seas.harvard.edu/motorlab/) with Maurice Smith. In my research, I use psychophysical experiments to study how the human brain controls movements.
