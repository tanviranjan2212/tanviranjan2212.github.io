title: "Sensory cancellation is highly precise"
image:
excerpt: "Sensory cancellation is one of the most remarkable mechanisms our nervous system uses to distinguish self-generated action from environmentally-generated actions, thus allowing for environmental signals to be processed effectively. A classic example is the inability to tickle onself because the motor system predicts the sensation beforehand and cancels the overall sensation. In this project, we showed that such sensory cancellation is highly accurate, in that the motor system can predict very small movements with high fidelity. This means that even though our actions are not always precise, our prediction about the consequences of those actions are very precise"
