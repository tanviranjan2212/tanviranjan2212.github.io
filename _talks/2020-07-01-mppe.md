excerpt: "When learning to perform a new action (e.g., making a tennis serve), one has information about final motor performance as well as continuous error signal in the form of the ball's trajectory. Both these error signals are useful predictors of motor adaptation. In this work, we asked which of these two error signals drives the short-term component of learning. Our results show that it is the motor performance error that drives motor adaptation in the short-term"
