excerpt: "Perceptual decision-making tasks involve transforming continuous sensory inputs into discrete decisions and continuous actions (Parr & Friston, 2018). This transformation occurs across a large network of brain areas. In mice performing such a task, neurons encoding choice are localized in forebrain and midbrain regions, while neurons encoding action initiation are distributed across the brain (Steinmetz et al. 2019). Whether the representation of brain-wide neural activity during such a transformation evolves in a continuous or discrete manner remains unclear (VanRullen & Koch, 2003). Hidden Markov models (HMM) can be used to assess neural dynamics when latent neural states are assumed to be discrete. Here, we compare this approach with that describing smooth evolution of states by decoding behavior following either HMM, or independent component analysis (ICA) using data collected by [Steinmetz et al (2019).](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-1787-x)"
